![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)

## Description
* This application will take in information about employees on a software engineering team, then generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. 

## User Story
* As a manager a user want to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info so that a user have quick access to their emails and GitHub profiles.

## Acceptance Criteria
* Create a command-line application that accepts accepts user input using the provided starter code.
  * Create classes for each team member provided and export them. The tests for these classes (in the _tests_ directory) must ALL pass:
    * The first class is an Employee parent class with the following properties and methods:
        * name
        * id
        * email
        * getName()
        * getId()
        * getEmail()
        * getRole()—returns 'Employee'
    * In addition to Employee's properties and methods, Manager will also have the following:
        * officeNumber
        * getRole()—overridden to return 'Manager'
    * In addition to Employee's properties and methods, Engineer will also have the following::
        * github—GitHub username
        * getGithub()
        * getRole()—overridden to return 'Engineer'
    * In addition to Employee's properties and methods, Intern will also have the following:
        * school
        * getSchool()
        * getRole()—overridden to return 'Intern'
    * Finally, although it’s not a requirement, consider adding validation to ensure that user input is in the proper format.
    * Write code in index.js that uses inquirer to gather information about the development team members and creates objects for each team member using the correct classes as blueprints.
        * When a user starts the application then they are prompted to enter the team manager’s:
            * Name
            * Employee ID
            * Email address
            * Office number
        * When a user enters those requirements then the user is presented with a menu with the option to:
            * Add an engineer
            * Add an intern
            * Finish building the team
        * When a user selects the engineer option then a user is prompted to enter the following and then the user is taken back to the menu:
            * Engineer's Name
            * ID
            * Email
            * GitHub username
        * When a user selects the intern option then a user is prompted to enter the following and then the user is taken back to the menu:
            * Intern’s name
            * ID
            * Email
            * School
        * When a user decides to finish building their team then they exit the application, and the HTML is generated.
    * Call the render function (provided for you) and pass in an array containing all employee objects;
        * The render function will generate and return a block of HTML including templated divs for each employee!
    * Create an HTML file using the HTML returned from the render function.
        * Write it to a file named team.html in the output folder.
        * You can use the provided variable outputPath to target this location.
